      "CHARLOTTE, N.C., Feb. 26, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Home improvement projects are up this year with more than three in four (77%) homeowners planning to renovate, an increase from 73% in 2019, according to the seventh annual LightStream Home Improvement Trends Survey, conducted by Wakefield Research.* \n",
      "U.S. homeowners plan to spend an average of $11,473 on renovations, an increase of 27% from 2019 ($9,006.60). Millennial homeowners plan to do the most work and spend more than others, with 92% doing projects at an average cost of $13,838 – more than any other generation.\n",
      "\"Our 2020 survey noted that 66% of homeowners say they'll stay in place for at least the next 10 years,\" said Todd Nelson, senior vice president of strategic partnerships at LightStream. \"This helps explain record-low real estate inventories and higher home prices across the country.\" \n",
      "What do homeowners want for these forever homes? \n",
      "As for why they are making these updates, the survey found that three out of five homeowners (60%) have an area they would be embarrassed to show guests visiting for the first time. Eighty-three percent say they have spaces they would renovate or build, but just haven't gotten around to it. \n",
      "Why the delay? The number one reason homeowners put off home remodeling projects is lack of funds (46%). Those deciding to move forward this year are divided on how they plan to pay for their projects. Nearly two-thirds (65%) will use savings, while a third (33%) will tap credit cards. Among credit card users, 19% said they did not know how long it would take to pay off their balances. For consumers who are reluctant to dip into savings or concerned about the high interest rates many credit cards charge, home improvement loans are being seen as an increasingly popular payment option. \n",
      "\"LightStream funded 40% more home improvement applications in 2019 than the previous year,\" continued Nelson. \"Consumers are recognizing that an unsecured consumer loan can be a smart financial tool, with an easy application process, low fixed interest rates, longer terms, fast funding and in our case, no fees.\" \n",
      "Whatever the project, whatever the vision, a record number of homeowners see 2020 as the year to confidently take on overdue projects and finally get the most out of their homes. \n",

      "CHARLOTTE, N.C., Feb. 19, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- As the oldest millennials turn 40 this year, many are pursuing life milestones differently than their parents. A new Truist (NYSE: TFC) survey conducted by Wakefield Research finds millennials who have a financial plan cite debt repayment (57%), travel (48%) and increasing the amount they save for retirement (45%) as their top financial goals, outpacing traditional milestones like homeownership (40%), and starting or expanding a family (30%). With a different set of goals, many millennials can benefit from a new financial planning playbook.\n",
      "Millennial Playbook Part 1: Get on Track for Your DreamsNearly nine in 10 millennials (86%) have established personal financial goals for the next five years. At the same time, many have not created an emergency fund (69%) or a non-retirement savings account (68%) that can help them stay on track to achieving their goals.\n",
      "\"Long-term financial success is often the cumulative effect of many successful short-term goals and habits,\" said Joe Sicchitano, Head of Wealth Planning and Advice Delivery for SunTrust now Truist. \"It is encouraging that most millennials have identified financial goals, but achieving a goal requires a sustained commitment. Focusing on a short-term goal, like creating an emergency fund to cover unexpected expenses, can keep you on track to reaching your long-term aspirations.\"\n",
      "Expert Play #1: To achieve your long-term aspirations, establish short-term goals. This can include breaking down a large goal, like creating an emergency fund or paying off student loan debt, into smaller pieces. Achieving smaller goals can help keep you motivated, and create positive momentum and confidence.\n",
      "Millennial Playbook Part 2: A New Road to RetirementFour in five millennials (80%) plan to retire and, among those who do, 75% will rely on personal or retirement savings, 60% plan to use social security and 25% expect to use an inheritance. While most millennials plan to retire, only 40% report that they have a retirement account.\n",
      "Some millennials who haven't started saving for retirement are relying on prior generations to help fund their retirement. Nearly half of millennials (46%) have received or expect to receive an inheritance. Of those, 44% plan to use it to help fund their retirement.\n",
      "\"Even though more than half of millennials have not started saving for retirement, most are confident that they will retire,\" Sicchitano said. \"The defined-benefit plans their parents may have had are rare today, so millennials need to take control of their retirement savings. Some may rely on an inheritance. Others may retire from a career, but continue work that provides personal fulfillment and income. With decades before they will retire, millennials still have time to create a plan for the retirement that reflects and is designed by them.\"\n",
      "Expert Play #2: An inheritance and social security are great supplementary assets, but they are out of your control. You can control what you save for retirement. Sometimes, the biggest obstacle is to start saving. Pick a comfortable savings rate to start and increase it incrementally over time. As you achieve other goals, such as paying off debt, reallocate your debt payment to your retirement to boost your savings. \n",
      "Millennial Playbook Part 3: Millennials Turn to Familiar Faces for Financial Advice Many millennials who do not have a financial plan do not know where to start (41%) or whom to trust (31%). Millennials who get financial advice often turn to someone they know, such as their parents (42%), a significant other (40%) or a friend (32%). While 35% turn to a financial professional, like a banker or accountant, for advice, far fewer (16%) report working with a financial advisor.\n",
      "\"Millennials prefer to look to someone they know for advice, even if they do not have the expertise of a financial advisor,\" Sicchitano said. \"Seeking advice is a positive step, but remember – no two financial plans are the same. The plan you create and the decisions you make need to be based on your goals, not the goals of your parents or friends. Identifying what you want to achieve is the first step in any discussion about your finances.\"\n",
      "Expert Play #3: Many people are uncomfortable talking about money. Rather than approaching it as a dollars-and-cents conversation, start by discussing your goals. Are you more interested in a travel destination or debt elimination? Will you own or rent a home? Do you want to have kids? When you have your goals in place, the discussion with a family member or financial professional can focus on the \"plays\" you need to call to build the life you want.\n",

      "WASHINGTON, Jan. 31, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- This week, the National Development Council (NDC) celebrated 50 years of working in low-income urban and rural communities throughout the country, driving equitable economic development, job creation, and safe, decent affordable housing. During the celebration on Thursday, January 30th at Brooklyn's Kings Theatre – a project funded through the New Markets Tax Credit – NDC announced a $250,000 grant for Kings Theatre, as well as a Flatbush Avenue Small Business Loan Fund to support local and existing Brooklyn entrepreneurs. \n",
      "\"We are proud of the five decades of progress and advancement for underserved communities the National Development Council has fueled over the years,\" said Dan Marsh, NDC President. \"We are thrilled to announce this grant for Kings Theater and the Flatbush Avenue Small Business Loan Fund as part of our efforts to continue increasing the flow of capital for investment to build on our early efforts to revitalize and bring opportunity to diverse neighborhoods and communities across the country for the next 50 years.\"\n",
      "Since its founding in 1969, NDC has made a big impact driving investments to some of the poorest city neighborhoods, small towns and rural communities nationwide. NDC has deployed more than $750 million in NMTC financing for 93 community development projects in economically distressed communities that created 26,466 jobs. Through its small business lending, NDC has provided $266 million in loans to 706 businesses that created or retained more than 15,200 jobs. The organization also increased access to quality affordable housing in 30 states and Puerto Rico, by driving $2 billion in financing to 223 projects, resulting in 11,733 affordable units.  In addition, NDC has partnered with 100 municipal clients to develop social infrastructure and provided training to over 75,000 community development practitioners. \n",
      "This anniversary celebration honored two individuals close to the NDC, James J. Roszkowski, President of Discover Bank, and Ira Weinstein, Managing Principal for CohnReznick. They were recognized for their leadership, contributions and dedication to the mission of the National Development Council. \n",
      "James J. Roszkowski led Discover Bank in an investment, in partnership with the National Development Council, in the Delaware Innovation Space, a new incubator on the site of the DuPont Experimental Station, helping scientists and the associated support positions adapt to life after the layoffs associated with the Dow/DuPont merger. A new incubator project in partnership with the Delaware Technology Park, the National Development Council and the University of Delaware, focused on FinTech and consumer financial health, has been announced and will be opening in 2021. \n",
      "Ira Weinstein is active in areas of the public-private partnership and was instrumental in programs like the federal and state New Markets Tax Credit Programs, the federal and state historic tax credit programs, renewable energy tax credits for investment and production and the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit. Mr. Weinstein was also involved in the restoration of Kings Theatre, where the anniversary celebration was hosted on January 30, 2020. \n",
      "Hailed as a \"linchpin\" in the robust revival of its Flatbush neighborhood in Brooklyn, the restoration of Kings Theatre is a testimony to the power of strategic investment and community partnerships through NDC. The project began in 2013 with $95 million in financing from The City of New York, Brooklyn Borough President's Office, Dormitory Authority of the State of NY, Goldman Sachs, New Markets Tax Credit and Ace Theatrical. Completed in 2015, the revitalization of the structure faithfully restored the Theatre's original splendor while transforming it into a modern multi-purpose performance facility. \n",
      "NDC also recognized BB&T, now Truist, for its work with NDC since 1997. This continuing partnership with NDC's development finance training programs has helped to build the capacity of over 8,000 professionals in nonprofit development corporations, Small Business Development Centers, CDFIs, minority business accelerators and state and local governments\n",

Adjusted diluted earnings per common share increased $0.05 compared to the third quarter of 2019. Adjusted results produced an annualized ROA of 1.40 percent, an annualized ROCE of 10.84 percent and an annualized ROTCE of 18.60 percent.\n",
      "\"The successful completion of our merger was due to the hard work of thousands of Truist teammates and I am truly grateful for their efforts. Our integration and execution efforts are underway and going smoothly. While the fourth quarter of 2019 includes a number of costs necessary to complete the merger, our underlying performance is strong. Taxable-equivalent revenue for the fourth quarter of 2019 totaled $3.7 billion and adjusted net income was $1.0 billion,\" said Truist Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kelly S. King. \n",
      "\"This month, we continued to hit key milestones that will bring Truist to life for our clients and teammates. We shared Truist's purpose, mission, and values, which was positively embraced by our teammates. Our purpose to inspire and build better lives and communities is the reason Truist exists and the starting point for every decision we will make,\" said King. \"Our purpose is embedded in our visual brand identity, which was rolled out this month as well. Within our new monogram logo and colors, you can see elements that acknowledge our heritage companies and signal how we'll deliver a distinctive blend of touch and technology to build deeper trust with our clients.\"\n",

      "Fourth Quarter 2019 compared to Third Quarter 2019\n",
      "Total taxable-equivalent revenue was $3.7 billion for the fourth quarter of 2019, an increase of $624 million compared to the prior quarter, driven by an increase of $529 million in net interest income and an increase of $95 million in noninterest income.\n",
      "The net interest margin was 3.41 percent for the fourth quarter, up four basis points compared to the prior quarter. Average earning assets increased $59.7 billion, which primarily reflects a $41.6 billion increase in average total loans and leases and an $11.8 billion increase in average securities. Average interest earning trading assets and other earning assets increased $6.3 billion due to higher trading securities and interest-bearing balances at the Federal Reserve. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $47.2 billion, driven by an increase of $36.7 billion in average interest-bearing deposits, an increase of $7.3 billion in average long-term debt and an increase of $3.2 billion in short-term borrowings. The increases in the balances were primarily due to the merger. \n",
      "The yield on the total loan portfolio for the fourth quarter was 4.91 percent, down seven basis points compared to the prior quarter, primarily due to the impact on variable rate loans from the decrease in short-term rates, partially offset by the accretion of the fair value mark on the merged loans. The yield on the average securities portfolio for the fourth quarter was 2.65 percent, up five basis points compared to the prior quarter, primarily due to the October portfolio restructuring.\n",
      "The average cost of total deposits was 0.57 percent, down ten basis points compared to the prior quarter. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits was 0.82 percent, down 17 basis points compared to the prior quarter. The average rate on long-term debt was 2.92 percent, down 50 basis points compared to the prior quarter. The average rate on short-term borrowings was 2.15 percent, down 40 basis points compared to the prior quarter. The decreases in rates on deposits and other funding was largely attributable to the declines in the fed funds and LIBOR rates. The decrease in the rates on long-term debt also reflect the amortization of the fair value mark on the assumed debt.\n",
      "The provision for credit losses was $171 million, and net charge-offs were $192 million for the fourth quarter, compared to $117 million and $153 million, respectively, for the prior quarter. The increase in the provision for credit losses was primarily due to higher net charge-offs in the current quarter and an increase in the provision for unfunded commitments.\n",
      "Noninterest income was $1.4 billion, an increase of $95 million compared to the prior quarter. Excluding the securities losses of $116 million and $22 million of losses recognized from the transfer of mortgage loans to held for sale, noninterest income increased $233 million. Approximately $217 million of the variance is due to the contribution from the merger, with the remaining variance due to a seasonal increase in insurance income of $22 million.\n",
      "Noninterest expense was $2.6 billion for the fourth quarter, up $735 million compared to the prior quarter. Noninterest expense increased $189 million for merger-related and restructuring charges, including $169 million primarily related to the merger and $20 million related to the decision to exit a business, and an increase of $49 million for incremental operating expenses related to the merger. Excluding these items, noninterest expense was up $497 million, of which approximately $400 million of the variance was due to noninterest expenses from the merged operations.\n",
      "Personnel expense increased $304 million compared to the prior quarter. The increase primarily includes a $227 million impact for personnel expenses of the merged operations, a $41 million increase in incremental operating expenses related to the merger, and a $42 million increase in production-based and other incentives. Amortization of intangibles increased $42 million due to the new intangibles created in the merger.\n",
      "The provision for income taxes was $153 million for the fourth quarter, compared to $218 million for the prior quarter. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 17.4 percent, compared to 20.8 percent for the prior quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in the realization of income tax credits and a decrease in earnings during the current quarter.\n",
      "Fourth Quarter 2019 compared to Fourth Quarter 2018\n",
      "Total taxable-equivalent revenues were $3.7 billion for the fourth quarter of 2019, an increase of $686 million compared to the earlier quarter, which reflects an increase of $523 million in taxable-equivalent net interest income and an increase of $163 million in noninterest income. \n",
      "Net interest margin was 3.41 percent, down eight basis points compared to the earlier quarter. Average earning assets increased $65.9 billion. The increase in average earning assets reflects a $45.2 billion increase in average total loans and leases and a $14.1 billion increase in average securities. Average interest earning trading assets and other earning assets increased $6.6 billion due to higher trading securities and interest-bearing balances at the Federal Reserve. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $53.0 billion compared to the earlier quarter. Average interest-bearing deposits increased $42.1 billion, average long-term debt increased $6.4 billion and average short-term borrowings increased $4.5 billion. The yield on the total loan portfolio for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 4.91 percent, down five basis points compared to the earlier quarter, reflecting the impact of rate decreases, partially offset by the accretion from the merged loans. The yield on the average securities portfolio was 2.65 percent, up 12 basis points compared to the earlier period.\n",
      "The average cost of total deposits was 0.57 percent, up five basis points compared to the earlier quarter. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits was 0.82 percent, up four basis points compared to the earlier quarter. The average rate on short-term borrowings was 2.15 percent, down three basis points compared to the earlier quarter. The average rate on long-term debt was 2.92 percent, down 27 basis points compared to the earlier quarter. The lower rates on long-term debt also reflect the amortization of the fair value mark on the assumed debt.\n",
      "The provision for credit losses was $171 million, compared to $146 million for the earlier quarter. The increase in the provision for credit losses was primarily due to higher net-charge offs, partially offset by the residential mortgage loan sale in the current quarter. Net charge-offs for the fourth quarter of 2019 totaled $192 million compared to $143 million in the earlier quarter. \n",
      "Noninterest income for the fourth quarter of 2019 increased $163 million compared to the earlier quarter. Excluding the net change in securities losses of $118 million and $22 million of losses recognized from the transfer of mortgage loans to held for sale, noninterest income increased $303 million. Approximately $217 million of the variance is due to the contribution from the merger. Insurance income increased $22 million due to higher production. The remaining increase is due to $42 million in income related to assets for certain post-employment benefits, which is offset by higher personnel expense, and other sundry items.\n",
      "Noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of 2019 was up $791 million compared to the earlier quarter. Merger-related and restructuring charges and other incremental operating expenses related to the merger increased $147 million and $101 million, respectively. Excluding these charges, noninterest expense was up $543 million. Approximately $400 million of the remaining variance was the result of noninterest expenses associated with the merged operations. \n",
      "Personnel expense increased $369 million compared to the earlier quarter. The increase is largely attributable to a $227 million impact from the merged operations, an $80 million increase in incremental operating expenses related to the merger, a $40 million increase for certain post-employment benefits that are offset by higher noninterest income, and a $29 million increase in production-based and other incentives. Amortization of intangibles increased $37 million, primarily due to the new intangibles created in the merger. \n",
      "The provision for income taxes was $153 million for the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to $205 million for the earlier quarter. This produced an effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2019 of 17.4 percent, compared to 20.3 percent for the earlier quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in the realization of income tax credits and a decrease in earnings during the current quarter.\n",

      "Average commercial and industrial loans increased $18.1 billion, with the merged portfolio contributing $18.3 billion of the growth. Excluding the impact of the merged portfolio, commercial and industrial loans declined slightly compared to the prior quarter, as strong growth in mortgage warehouse lending, premium finance and equipment finance were more than offset by paydowns in the corporate banking portfolio. \n",
      "Average residential mortgage loans held for investment increased $6.4 billion, primarily due to $7.3 billion of the growth from the merged portfolio, partially offset by a decline due to the transfer of loans to held for sale and a higher proportion of loan originations being sold rather than retained in the portfolio.\n",

This includes nonperforming assets from the merger of $107 million of loans held for sale, $63 million of loans and leases held for investment and $63 million in other nonperforming assets. Nonperforming loans and leases held for investment represented 0.15 percent of loans and leases held for investment, down 15 basis points compared to September 30, 2019. The decline is primarily due to the impact of the merged nonperforming loans being accounted for on a pooled basis in PCI and the sale of $69 million of nonperforming mortgage loans. Upon adoption of CECL and the transition from pooled level accounting for PCI, nonperforming loans will be determined based on the individual loan level and aggregated for reporting. There are approximately $500 million of PCI loans that would be classified as nonperforming as of December 31, 2019.\n",
      "Performing TDRs were down $77 million during the fourth quarter primarily in residential mortgage loans due to the previously discussed sale, which was partially offset by an increase in commercial construction loans.\n",
      "Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing totaled $2.0 billion at December 31, 2019, up $1.6 billion compared to the prior quarter. This increase is a result of merged loans, including $1.2 billion of PCI loans, $193 million of government guaranteed residential mortgages and $187 million of government guaranteed student loans. The ratio of loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing as a percentage of loans and leases was 0.66 percent at December 31, 2019, an increase of 39 basis points from the prior quarter. Excluding government guaranteed and PCI loans, the ratio of loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing as a percentage of loans and leases was 0.03 percent at December 31, 2019, down from 0.04 percent at September 30, 2019.\n",
      "Loans 30-89 days past due and still accruing totaled $2.2 billion at December 31, 2019, up $1.2 billion compared to the prior quarter, primarily due to the merged portfolio, which added $1.2 billion. The ratio of loans 30-89 days or more past due and still accruing as a percentage of loans and leases was 0.74 percent at December 31, 2019, an increase of eight basis points from the prior quarter. The primary driver of the increase is the addition of the merged guaranteed student loan portfolio.\n",

      "The allowance for loan and lease losses, excluding the allowance for PCI loans, was $1.5 billion, down $24 million compared to the prior quarter. The decrease in the allowance for loan and lease losses was primarily due to the sale of residential mortgage loans during the fourth quarter. As of December 31, 2019, the total allowance for loan and lease losses was 0.52 percent of loans and leases held for investment. All of the merged loans were marked to fair value as of December 6, 2019 and therefore, there is no allowance related to these loans. Upon the adoption of CECL, an allowance will be established for all loans held for investment, with the portion related to non-PCI loans and leases charged to retained earnings.\n",
      "The allowance for loan and lease losses was 3.41 times nonperforming loans and leases held for investment, compared to 3.52 times at September 30, 2019.

      "NEW YORK, Jan. 8, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Fairstead, a fully-integrated real estate firm committed to the preservation of high quality housing, today announced the financing of a 905-unit portfolio of subsidized housing across nine properties (49 buildings) in New York City. Over the last six months, in nine distinct transactions, Fairstead restructured the $430 million portfolio with $310 million in HUD-insured financing.\n",
      "The portfolio, located throughout Brooklyn and Manhattan, had been on the verge of conversion to market-rate housing. Fairstead, the NYC Council Members who represent these neighborhoods, the Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD), and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) collaborated to rehabilitate and preserve this affordable housing. Fairstead entered into new regulatory agreements with HPD to ensure that all 905 units will remain affordable for at least the next 40 years.  \n",
      "The most recent transaction, which closed December 30, was a $46.4 million loan provided by Capital One and HUD for 680 St. Nicholas Avenue in Manhattan. Fairstead completed a comprehensive renovation of the property last year and introduced a social services platform as well as amenities including a new community room and enhanced connectivity services for residents. \n",
      "\"Preserving affordable housing allows families to stay in their homes while giving new life to the buildings they live in,\" said HPD Commissioner Louise Carroll. \"HPD is proud to work with Fairstead to rehabilitate hundreds of homes across nine properties, protecting this valuable housing, and giving New Yorkers the security of knowing they can afford to stay in their communities for years to come.\"\n",
      "Will Blodgett, co-founder and partner at Fairstead, credited NYC Council Members Laurie Cumbo, Carlos Menchaca, Bill Perkins, and Council Speaker Corey Johnson as well as HPD and HUD for their support of these transactions preserving affordable housing in their districts and jurisdictions.  \n",
      "\"Affordable housing continues to be a scarce resource in this country, especially in New York. Public-private partnerships are key to creating and maintaining this affordability and Fairstead is proud to work with city council members and agencies alike who recognize the importance of preserving these affordable units and Fairstead's ability to bring about positive change. We are incredibly proud of the entire team, for without these partnerships, none of this would have been possible. We thank everyone involved and look forward to keeping these units as deeply affordable for at least the next 40 years.\"\n",
      "The portfolio is comprised of:\n",
      "\"Today's announcement is a triumph of the Sunset Park community's resilience, and the power of our community to work together and fight to keep families in affordable homes,\" said City Council Member Carlos Menchaca. \"When I was elected in 2013, I promised I would fight to preserve affordable housing in our district. This led to a partnership with Fairstead and the inclusion in their portfolio of four Sunset Park buildings. I am proud to stand with Fairstead as they announce their entire portfolio will remain affordable for the next 40 years, including those in Sunset Park. There is still more work to do, but with this victory, I am more optimistic than ever.\"\n",
      "The portfolio was financed with HUD-insured 223f loans, which allowed Fairstead to invest over $35 million to upgrade all buildings with a full interior renovation of units and common areas.  These renovations include: new cabinetry, countertops, tiling, low-flow fixtures in all kitchens and bathrooms, sustainability measures to significantly reduce utility costs, handicap accessibility improvements, infrastructure upgrades and improved security and connectivity. \n",
      "\"This administration is committed to the preservation of affordable housing, especially in such a densely populated region as New York City,\" said Lynne Patton, HUD Regional Administrator for New York and New Jersey.  \"Through the HUD-insured 223f loan program, $310 million was financed to renovate existing homes and ensure residents have access to the decent, safe and sanitary housing units they deserve.\"\n",
      "\"At Fairstead, we are committed to bringing together all public and private partners to achieve the rehabilitation and long-term preservation of healthy, safe, and socially vibrant communities,\" said John Tatum, partner at Fairstead. \"This transaction further demonstrates our expertise in large scale, tenant-in-place rehabs.  It also highlights our growing presence in the New York market.\" \n",
      "Fairstead's design and construction team will lead the full tenant-in-place rehab.  The team has already completed Plaza Apartments and St. Nicholas Manor Apartments. The remainder of the portfolio is under construction and expected to be completed in 2020.\n",
      "\"Plaza Apartments is an example of a successful collaboration between NYC Council, HPD, and HUD,\" said Majority Leader Laurie Cumbo of District 35 in Brooklyn. \"I am very pleased that people who need affordable housing will get the quality that a brand-new upgrade allows, and the management accountability they so deserve.\"\n",
      "The financing was arranged by the FHA teams of multiple lending partners, including Truist, Greystone, Capital One, and Meridian Capital Group.\n",
      "About FairsteadFairstead is a socially responsible, fully-integrated real estate investor, developer, owner and operator specializing in affordable, mixed-income, and market-rate housing. Fairstead utilizes a purpose-driven, innovative approach and has acquired, developed or preserved nearly 15,000 units since inception.

      "WINSTON-SALEM, North Carolina, 18 oktober 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- BB&T Corporation (NYSE: BBT) kondigde vandaag haar inkomsten voor het derde kwartaal van 2019 aan. De netto-inkomsten voor gewone aandeelhouders bedroegen $735 miljoen, een daling van 6,8% in vergelijking met het derde kwartaal van vorig jaar. De inkomsten per verwaterd gewoon aandeel bedroegen $0,95 voor het derde kwartaal van 2019, een daling van 5,9 procent vergeleken met dezelfde periode vorig jaar. De resultaten voor het derde kwartaal leverden een rendement op jaarbasis op gemiddelde activa (ROA) op van 1,41 procent, een rendement op jaarbasis op gemiddeld vermogen van gewone aandeelhouders (ROCE) van 10,04 procent en een rendement op jaarbasis op vast kernkapitaal van aandeelhouders (ROTCE) van 16,03 procent.\n",
      "Netto-inkomsten voor gewone aandeelhouders bedroegen $832 miljoen of $1,07 per verwaterd aandeel, buiten beschouwing van fusie- en herstructuringskosten van $34 miljoen ($26 miljoen na aftrek van belastingen), incrementele bedrijfskosten met betrekking tot de fusie van $52 miljoen ($ 40 miljoen na aftrek van belastingen) en een betaling na belastingen van $46 miljoen met betrekking tot de aflossing van preferente aandelen, gedeeltelijk gecompenseerd door de impact na belastingen van de verkoop van particuliere hypothecaire leningen van $15 miljoen. Aangepaste verwaterde inkomsten per gewoon aandeel stegen $0,04 vergeleken met het derde kwartaal van 2018. Aangepaste resultaten produceerden een ROA op jaarbasis van 1,50 procent, een ROCE op jaarbasis van 11,36 procent en een ROTCE op jaarbasis van 18,07 procent.\n",
      "\"We zijn verheugd om sterke resultaten voor het derde kwartaal te kunnen melden, met verbeterde gecorrigeerde inkomsten dankzij hogere inkomsten en lagere kredietkosten\", zei Chairman en Chief Executive Officer Kelly S. King. \"Terwijl de gemiddelde leningen aangehouden voor investeringen met 4,8 procent daalden, was dit resultaat te wijten aan onze strategische beslissing om gedurende het kwartaal ongeveer $4 miljard aan hypothecaire leningen te verkopen. Met uitzondering van deze verkoop genereerde ons bedrijf een sterke kredietgroei van 6,5 procent op jaarbasis in vergelijking met het vorige kwartaal.\n",
      "\"Daarnaast genoten we 2,5 procent belastbare omzetgroei vergeleken met het derde kwartaal van vorig jaar, geleid door sterke resultaten van onze activiteiten voor het genereren van vergoedingen, waaronder verzekeringen, hypotheekbankieren en investeringsbankieren en makelaardij, evenals een veerkrachtige netto rentemarge in deze uitdagende koersomgeving. Dit was deels te wijten aan lagere depositokosten, die het afgelopen kwartaal piekten.\n",
      "\"We blijven aanzienlijke vooruitgang boeken bij het leggen van de basis voor onze opwindende fusie van gelijken met SunTrust,\" zei King. \"We zijn erg blij dat de aandeelhouders van beide bedrijven de fusie eerder dit kwartaal sterk hebben ondersteund.

      "WINSTON-SALEM, Carolina del Nord, 18 ottobre 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- BB&T Corporation (NYSE: BBT) oggi ha dichiarato gli utili relativi al terzo trimestre del 2019. Il reddito netto a disposizione degli azionisti comuni è stato di 735 milioni di dollari, con una riduzione del 6,8 percento, rispetto al terzo trimestre dell'anno precedente. Gli utili per azione diluita comune sono stati di 0,95 dollari per il terzo trimestre 2019, una diminuzione del 5,9 percento rispetto allo stesso periodo dell'anno precedente. I risultati per il terzo trimestre hanno prodotto un ritorno su base annua sugli asset medi (ROA) pari all'1,41 percento, un ritorno su base annua dei titoli degli azionisti medi (ROCE) del 10,04 percento, e un ritorno su base annua sui titoli degli azioni comuni tangibili (ROTCE) del 16,03 percento.\n",
      "Il reddito netto rettificato a disposizione degli azionisti comuni è stato pari a 832 milioni di dollari, ovvero 1,07 dollari per azione diluita, escludendo i costi correlati alle fusioni e alle ristrutturazioni di 34 milioni di dollari (26 milioni di dollari dopo le imposte), le spese operative incrementali correlate alla fusione di 52 milioni di dollari (40 milioni di dollari dopo le imposte) e un costo dopo le imposte di 46 milioni di dollari correlati al riscatto di azioni preferenziali, in parte compensato dall'impatto dopo le tasse della vendita di mutui ipotecari residenziali per 15 milioni di dollari. Gli utili diluiti rettificati per azione comune sono aumentati di 0,04 dollari rispetto al terzo trimestre del 2018. I risultati rettificati hanno determinato un ROA su base annua pari all'1,50 percento, un ROCE su base annua dell'11,36 percento e un ROTCE su base annua del 18,07 percento.\n",
      "\"Siamo felici di poter dichiarare risultati solidi per il terzo trimestre, con utili rettificati ancora migliori sostenuti da ricavi più sostenuti e costi inferiori per il credito,\" ha dichiarato il Presidente del CdA e Amministratore Delegato Kelly S. King. \"Mentre i prestiti medi detenuti a titolo di investimento sono diminuiti del 4,8 percento, questo risultato è stato possibile grazie alla nostra decisione strategica di vendere circa 4 miliardi circa di mutui ipotecari nel corso del trimestre. Escludendo questa vendita, la nostra società ha generato una robusta crescita dei prestiti del 6,5 percento su base annua rispetto all'ultimo trimestre.\n",
      "\"Inoltre, abbiamo registrato una crescita dei ricavi equivalenti imponibili del 2,5 percento rispetto al terzo trimestre dello scorso anno sostenuti da risultati più solidi derivanti dalle nostre attività che generano commissioni, tra cui le assicurazioni, il settore bancario per i mutui e l'attività di intermediazione, oltre a un margine di interesse netto resiliente in questa difficile situazione per i tassi. Questo è stato determinato in parte da costi inferiori dei depositi, che hanno registrato un picco nello scorso trimestre.\n",
      "\"Continuiamo a registrare progressi significativi mentre gettiamo le basi per una fusione paritaria con SunTrust,\" ha dichiarato King. \"Siamo davvero felici e gli azionisti di entrambe le società hanno sostenuto con vigore la fusione nelle riunioni in merito tenute in precedenza nel corso di questo trimestre. E cosa importante, abbiamo nominato circa il 75 percento dei ruoli dirigenziali dell'organizzazione Truist, e in questo modo siamo ben pronti a guardare in avanti alla conclusione della fusione.\"\n",

Der den Stammaktionären zurechenbare Nettogewinn erreichte 735 Millionen US-Dollar, ist also um 6,8 Prozent geringer als im dritten Quartal des vergangenen Jahres. Der Gewinn pro verwässerter Stammaktie belief sich auf 0,95 US-Dollar und ist im Vergleich zum entsprechenden Zeitraum im Vorjahr somit um 5,9 Prozent geringer. Die Ergebnisse des dritten Quartals zeigten eine annualisierte Rentabilität der durchschnittlichen Aktiva (annualized return on average assets; ROA) von 1,41 Prozent und eine annualisierte Rentabilität des durchschnittlichen Eigenkapitals für Stammaktionäre (return on average common shareholders' equity; ROCE) von 10,04 Prozent. Die Rentabilität des durchschnittlichen materiellen Eigenkapitals für Stammaktionäre (annualized return on tangible common shareholders' equity; ROTCE) betrug 16,03 Prozent.\n",

King, Vorsitzender und CEO. „Während die durchschnittlichen Investitionskredite um 4,8 Prozent zurückgingen, ist dieses Ergebnis auf unsere strategische Entscheidung zurückzuführen, im Laufe des Quartals rund 4 Milliarden US-Dollar an Hypothekarkrediten zu verkaufen. Ungeachtet dieser Verkäufe erzielte unser Unternehmen auf annualisierter Basis ein solides Wachstum um 6,5 Prozent bei Darlehen gegenüber dem Vorquartal.\n",
      "„Außerdem konnten wir im Vergleich zum dritten Quartal des Vorjahres ein Wachstum von 2,5 Prozent in unserem steuerlich äquivalenten Umsatz verbuchen, das wir der starken Leistung unserer Hypothekenbank-, Versicherungs-, Broker- und Investmentbankingsparte sowie einer widerstandsfähigen Nettozinsspanne trotz eines herausfordernden Zinsumfelds zuschreiben.

Le bénéfice par action ordinaire dilué s'est établi à 0,95 dollar pour le troisième trimestre 2019, en baisse de 5,9 pour cent par rapport à la période correspondante de l'exercice précédent.

En excluant cette vente, notre société a généré une forte croissance des prêts de 6,5 pour cent sur une base annualisée par rapport au trimestre précédent.\n",
      "« De plus, nous avons bénéficié d'une croissance de 2,5 pour cent du chiffre d'affaires sur une base d'imposition comparable par rapport au troisième trimestre de l'exercice précédent, grâce aux solides résultats issus de nos activités génératrices de recettes provenant des cotisations, notamment les assurances, les services bancaires de prêts hypothécaires et les services bancaires d'investissement et de courtage, ainsi qu'à une marge nette d'intérêts solide dans ce contexte tarifaire difficile.

Excluding the $5 million and $205 million insurance settlement benefits related to financial crisis-era related claims recognized in the current quarter and prior quarter, respectively, total revenue was stable sequentially and increased 2% year-over-year driven by higher noninterest income.\n",
      "Net Interest Income\n",
      "Net interest income was $1.5 billion for the third quarter of 2019, a decrease of $25 million compared to the prior quarter due primarily to lower earning asset yields, which drove a decline in the net interest margin, partially offset by a $1.4 billion, or 1%, increase in average performing LHFI. Net interest income was stable relative to the prior year as the decline in the net interest margin was offset by 8% growth in average performing LHFI and 2% growth in average client deposits.\n",
      "Net interest margin for the current quarter was 3.06%, compared to 3.16% and 3.27% in the prior quarter and prior year, respectively, driven primarily by declines in short-term and long-term interest rates (which negatively impacted earning asset yields). The year-over-year decline was also impacted by higher funding costs.\n",
      "For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, net interest income was $4.7 billion, a $150 million, or 3%, increase compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2018. The net interest margin was 3.16% for the first nine months of 2019, a 10 basis point decrease compared to the same period in 2018. The decrease in net interest margin was driven primarily by a 45 basis point increase in rate paid on average interest-bearing liabilities, which was offset partially by a 27 basis point increase in earning asset yields.\n",
      "Noninterest Income\n",
      "Noninterest income was $843 million for the current quarter, compared to $1.0 billion for the prior quarter and $782 million for the third quarter of 2018. Excluding the $5 million and $205 million insurance settlement benefits related to financial crisis-era related claims recognized in the current and prior quarters, respectively, noninterest income increased $18 million sequentially and $56 million year-over-year. The sequential increase was driven largely by higher mortgage-related income and investment banking income. The year-over-year increase was driven by increases across most categories, most notably a $23 million increase in mortgage-related income.\n",
      "Client transaction-related fees (namely service charges on deposits, other charges and fees, and card fees) increased $5 million sequentially and $6 million year-over-year. The sequential increase was driven by one more day during the current quarter, while the year-over-year increase was driven primarily by certain discrete impacts (recorded as contra-revenue) recognized in card fees in the third quarter of 2018.\n",
      "Investment banking income was $159 million for the current quarter, compared to $142 million in the prior quarter and $150 million for the third quarter of 2018. The $17 million sequential increase was due primarily to higher syndicated finance and M&A activity, while the year-over-year increase was driven by higher syndicated finance and investment grade bond origination activity, partially offset by a decline in equity capital markets.\n",
      "Mortgage-related income for the current quarter was $106 million, compared to $86 million for the prior quarter and $83 million for the third quarter of 2018. The sequential and year-over-year increases were driven primarily by higher production-related income due to increased refinance and purchase volumes, partially offset by higher decay expense which negatively impacted servicing income. At September 30, 2019, the servicing portfolio totaled $165.6 billion, down 1% compared to the prior quarter and 3% year-over-year.\n",
      "Trading income was $29 million for the current quarter, compared to $55 million for the prior quarter and $42 million for the prior year. The sequential and year-over-year decreases were largely driven by an increase in counterparty credit valuation reserves in the current quarter. The sequential decrease was also impacted by lower fixed income sales and trading revenue.\n",
      "Commercial real estate-related income was $32 million for the current quarter, compared to $50 million for the prior quarter and $24 million for the prior year. The sequential decline was primarily attributable to lower structured real estate related income, while the year-over-year increase was driven by higher structured real estate related income and higher commercial mortgage production and servicing income from the Company's agency lending business.\n",
      "Net securities gains/(losses) totaled gains of $4 million for the current quarter compared to losses of ($42) million in the prior quarter that arose from a repositioning of the Company's securities AFS portfolio. There were no net securities gains/(losses) in the prior year quarter.\n",
      "Other noninterest income was $40 million for the current quarter, compared to $72 million in the prior quarter and $21 million in the third quarter of 2018. The sequential decrease was due primarily to a $44 million gain on the sale of accruing TDRs during the second quarter of 2019. The year-over-year increase was due primarily to $10 million in net remeasurement gains on equity investments recognized during the current quarter.\n",
      "For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, noninterest income was $2.7 billion, compared to $2.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2018. The $245 million increase compared to the prior year was driven primarily by the insurance settlement benefits recognized in the current and prior quarter as well as higher commercial real estate-related and mortgage-related income.\n",
      "Noninterest Expense\n",
      "Noninterest expense was $1.5 billion in the current quarter, down $164 million sequentially and an increase of $90 million compared to the third quarter of 2018. Excluding the $205 million charitable contribution to the SunTrust Foundation in the prior quarter and the merger-related impacts of $33 million in the current quarter and $14 million in the prior quarter, noninterest expense increased $22 million sequentially and $57 million year-over-year. The $22 million sequential increase was driven primarily by higher employee compensation and benefits costs and higher operating losses. The $57 million year-over-year increase was driven by higher employee compensation and benefits, net occupancy expense, and ongoing investments in technology.\n",
      "Employee compensation and benefits expense was $841 million in the current quarter, compared to $828 million in the prior quarter and $795 million in the third quarter of 2018. The $13 million sequential increase was driven primarily by higher salary costs (due to one additional day in the quarter) and higher contract programming costs. The $46 million year-over-year increase was driven primarily by higher salary and benefits costs in the current quarter.\n",
      "Outside processing and software expense was $241 million in both the current and prior quarter, $7 million higher than the third quarter of 2018. The year-over-year increase was driven primarily by higher software-related costs resulting from the amortization of new and upgraded technology assets.\n",
      "Net occupancy expense was $102 million in the current quarter, stable compared to the prior quarter and $16 million higher than the third quarter of 2018. The year-over-year increase was driven primarily by lease termination gains recognized in the prior year quarter and higher rent expense in the current quarter.\n",
      "Merger-related costs are expenses associated with the Company's proposed merger of equals with BB&T Corporation as announced on February 7, 2019. Current quarter costs totaled $22 million and were primarily comprised of legal and professional services and write-offs of certain technology development projects in progress. In addition to these costs, there were $11 million of other merger-related expenses (consulting fees and retention payments) that were primarily recorded in 'other noninterest expense'.\n",
      "Operating losses were $23 million in the current quarter, compared to $14 million in the prior quarter and $18 million in the third quarter of 2018. The sequential and year-over-year increases were driven primarily by higher fraud costs recognized during the current quarter.\n",
      "Regulatory assessments expense was $17 million in both the current and prior quarter, $22 million lower than the prior year. The year-over-year decrease was driven by the cessation of the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund surcharge in the fourth quarter of 2018.\n",
      "Other noninterest expense was $127 million in the current quarter, compared to $124 million in the prior quarter and $108 million in the third quarter of 2018. The $19 million year-over-year increase was driven primarily by merger-related impacts in the current quarter (primarily consulting fees).\n",
      "For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, noninterest expense was $4.6 billion compared to $4.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2018. The $411 million increase was driven largely by the $205 million charitable contribution and $92 million in merger-related impacts. Excluding these, expenses were up 3% driven by a $53 million increase in outside processing and software, a $42 million increase in employee compensation and benefits, and a $35 million increase in net occupancy expense.\n",
      "Income Taxes\n",
      "For the third quarter of 2019, the Company recorded a provision for income taxes of $122 million compared to $105 million for the prior quarter and $95 million for the third quarter of 2018. The effective tax rate for the current quarter was 16%, compared to 13% in the prior quarter and 11% in the third quarter of 2018. The prior quarter included $32 million of discrete tax benefits related primarily to the resolution of certain tax matters, while the third quarter of 2018 included $67 million of discrete tax benefits related to the finalization of the impact of tax reform and the completion of the merger of SunTrust Mortgage into SunTrust Bank.\n",
      "Balance Sheet\n",
      "At September 30, 2019, the Company had total assets of $227.4 billion and total shareholders' equity of $26.5 billion, representing 12% of total assets. Book value per common share was $54.87 and tangible book value per common share was $40.58, both up 3% compared to June 30, 2019, driven primarily by growth in retained earnings and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss.\n",
      "Loans and Deposits\n",
      "Average performing LHFI totaled $157.1 billion for the current quarter, up 1% compared to the prior quarter and up 8% compared to the prior year. The sequential growth was driven primarily by increases in CRE, consumer direct, consumer indirect loans, and residential mortgages, offset partially by declines in commercial construction loans and residential home equity products. The year-over-year increase was also positively impacted by 8% growth in C&I loans.\n",
      "Average consumer and commercial deposits totaled $162.5 billion for the current quarter, a 2% increase compared to both the prior quarter and the third quarter of 2018. Sequential growth was driven primarily by increases in NOW accounts, money market accounts, and time deposits. Year-over-year growth was driven by increases in NOW accounts and time deposits, offset partially by declines in demand deposits and money market accounts.\n",
      "Capital and Liquidity\n",
      "The Company's estimated capital ratios were well above current regulatory requirements with the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio estimated to be 9.3% at September 30, 2019. The ratios of average total equity to average total assets and tangible common equity to tangible assets were 11.7% and 8.2%, respectively, at September 30, 2019. Additionally, the Company declared a common stock dividend of $0.56 per common share in the third quarter of 2019, up 12% compared to both the prior quarter and the third quarter of 2018. The Company continues to have substantial available liquidity in the form of cash, high-quality government-backed or government-sponsored securities, and other available contingency funding sources.\n",
      "Asset Quality\n",
      "Overall asset quality performance continues to be strong. Nonperforming assets (\"NPAs\") totaled $661 million at September 30, 2019, up $63 million from the prior quarter and down $93 million year-over-year. The ratio of NPLs to period-end LHFI was 0.38%, 0.34%, and 0.47% at September 30, 2019, June 30, 2019, and September 30, 2018, respectively. The year-over-year decrease was driven primarily by lower residential mortgage NPLs due to loans transitioning from non-accruing status (as a result of forbearance relief provided after hurricanes) back to accruing status.\n",
      "Net charge-offs totaled $112 million during the current quarter, an increase of $27 million compared to the prior quarter and $24 million compared to the third quarter of 2018. The ratio of annualized net charge-offs to total average LHFI was 0.28% for the current quarter, compared to 0.22% for the prior quarter and 0.24% for the prior year.\n",
      "The provision for credit losses was $132 million in the current quarter, an increase of $5 million sequentially and $71 million year-over-year. The sequential increase was driven primarily by higher net charge-offs. The year-over-year increase reflects both higher net charge-offs and a release of loan loss reserves in the prior year quarter. At September 30, 2019, the ALLL was $1.7 billion, which represented 1.07% of period-end loans, stable relative to June 30, 2019 and a 3 basis point decline relative to September 30, 2018, the latter of which was driven by improved asset quality.\n",
      "Early stage delinquencies decreased 1 basis point from the prior quarter and 16 basis points from September 30, 2018 to 0.58% at September 30, 2019. Excluding government-guaranteed loans, early stage delinquencies were 0.23%, which was stable compared to the prior quarter and down 1 basis point compared to the third quarter of 2018.\n",

Revenue and income amounts labeled \"FTE\" in the business segment tables are reported on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. For the business segments, net interest income is computed using matched-maturity funds transfer pricing and noninterest income includes federal and state tax credits that are grossed-up on a pre-tax equivalent basis. Further, provision/(benefit) for credit losses represents net charge-offs by segment combined with an allocation to the segments of the provision/(benefit) attributable to each segment's quarterly change in the allowance for loan and lease losses (\"ALLL\") and unfunded commitments reserve balances. SunTrust also reports results for Corporate Other, which includes the Treasury department as well as the residual expense associated with operational and support expense allocations. The Total Corporate Other results presented in this document also include Reconciling Items, which are comprised of differences created between internal management accounting practices and U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"U.S. GAAP\") and certain matched-maturity funds transfer pricing credits and charges. A detailed discussion of the business segment results will be included in the Company's forthcoming Form 10-Q.\n",

      "Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThis news release includes non-GAAP financial measures to describe SunTrust's performance. Additional information and reconciliations of those measures to GAAP measures are provided in the appendix to this news release beginning at page 12.\n",
      "In this news release, consistent with SEC Industry Guide 3, the Company presents total revenue, net interest income, net interest margin, and efficiency ratios on a fully taxable equivalent (\"FTE\") basis, and ratios on an annualized basis. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments using a federal tax rate of 21%, as well as state income taxes, where applicable, to increase tax-exempt interest income to a taxable-equivalent basis. The Company believes this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. Total revenue-FTE equals net interest income-FTE plus noninterest income.\n",
      "The Company presents the following additional non-GAAP measures because many investors find them useful. Specifically:\n",

The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of Net interest income from certain loans and investments using a federal tax rate of 21%, as well as state income taxes where applicable to increase tax-exempt interest income to a taxable-equivalent basis.

The Company believes this measure is useful to investors because it is more reflective of normalized operations as it reflects results that are primarily client relationship and client transaction driven. Removing these items also allows investors to more easily compare the Company's tangible efficiency to other companies in the industry that may not have had similar items impacting their results.

      "WINSTON-SALEM, N.C., Oct. 17, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- BB&T Corporation (NYSE: BBT) today reported earnings for the third quarter of 2019. Net income available to common shareholders was $735 million, down 6.8 percent, compared with the third quarter last year. Earnings per diluted common share were $0.95 for the third quarter of 2019, a decrease of 5.9 percent compared with the same period last year. Results for the third quarter produced an annualized return on average assets (ROA) of 1.41 percent, an annualized return on average common shareholders' equity (ROCE) of 10.04 percent, and an annualized return on tangible common shareholders' equity (ROTCE) of 16.03 percent.\n",
      "Adjusted net income available to common shareholders was $832 million, or $1.07 per diluted share, excluding merger-related and restructuring charges of $34 million ($26 million after-tax), incremental operating expenses related to the merger of $52 million ($40 million after-tax) and an after-tax charge of $46 million related to the redemption of preferred stock, partially offset by the after-tax impact from the sale of residential mortgage loans of $15 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per common share increased $0.04 compared to the third quarter of 2018. Adjusted results produced an annualized ROA of 1.50 percent, an annualized ROCE of 11.36 percent and an annualized ROTCE of 18.07 percent.\n",
      "\"We are pleased to report strong results for the third quarter, with improved adjusted earnings driven by stronger revenues and lower credit costs,\" said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kelly S. King. \"While average loans held for investment decreased 4.8 percent, this result was due to our strategic decision to sell approximately $4 billion in mortgage loans during the quarter. Excluding this sale, our company generated robust loan growth of 6.5 percent on an annualized basis compared with last quarter.\n",
      "\"In addition, we enjoyed 2.5 percent taxable-equivalent revenue growth compared with the third quarter last year led by strong results from our fee income-generating businesses, including insurance, mortgage banking and investment banking and brokerage, as well as a resilient net interest margin in this challenging rate environment. This was due in part to lower deposit costs, which peaked last quarter.\n",
      "\"We continue to make significant progress laying the groundwork for our exciting merger of equals with SunTrust,\" said King. \"We are very pleased the shareholders of both companies strongly supported the merger at their respective meetings earlier this quarter. Importantly, we have named approximately 75 percent of leadership roles for the Truist organization, so we are well prepared as we look forward to closing the merger.\"\n",

      "Third Quarter 2019 compared to Second Quarter 2019\n",
      "Total taxable-equivalent revenues were $3.0 billion for the third quarter of 2019, a decrease of $40 million compared to the prior quarter, primarily driven by a decrease of $49 million in noninterest income.\n",
      "The net interest margin was 3.37 percent for the third quarter, down five basis points compared to the prior quarter. Three basis points of the decrease was due to the residential mortgage loan sale and the reinvestment into securities during the current quarter. Average earning assets increased $2.6 billion, which primarily reflects a $2.8 billion increase in average securities and a $485 million increase in average total loans and leases. The increase in average total loans and leases was impacted by the sale of $4.3 billion of residential mortgage loans during the third quarter. Average other earning assets decreased $701 million due to lower average trading securities. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $1.6 billion, driven by an increase of $2.3 billion in average interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a decrease of $625 million in average long-term debt.\n",
      "The yield on the total loan portfolio for the third quarter was 4.98 percent, down seven basis points compared to the prior quarter, primarily due to the impact on variable rate loans from the decrease in short-term rates. The yield on the average securities portfolio for the third quarter was 2.60 percent, down two basis points compared to the prior quarter.\n",
      "The average cost of total deposits was 0.67 percent, down one basis point compared to the prior quarter. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits was 0.99 percent, down three basis points compared to the prior quarter. The average rate on long-term debt was 3.42 percent, up nine basis points compared to the prior quarter. The average rate on short-term borrowings was 2.55 percent, up 15 basis points compared to the prior quarter. The increases in rates on short-term borrowings and long-term debt were due to higher costs from hedging activities.\n",
      "The provision for credit losses was $117 million, and net charge-offs were $153 million for the third quarter, compared to $172 million and $142 million, respectively, for the prior quarter. The decrease in the provision for credit losses was primarily due to the sale of residential mortgage loans and a decrease in the reserve for unfunded commitments.\n",
      "Noninterest income was $1.3 billion, a decrease of $49 million compared to the prior quarter. Insurance income decreased $79 million primarily due to seasonality. Mortgage banking income was essentially flat compared to the prior quarter, as increases from production and servicing related revenues in the residential and commercial mortgage banking businesses of $24 million were offset by a decline of $25 million for the net valuation of mortgage services rights valuation adjustments in the prior quarter. Other income increased $35 million, primarily due to a $23 million increase in income related to assets for certain post-employment benefits, which is offset by higher personnel expense, and an increase from client derivatives.\n",
      "Noninterest expense was $1.8 billion for the third quarter, up $89 million compared to the prior quarter. Noninterest expense includes $34 million of merger-related and restructuring charges primarily related to the merger of equals with SunTrust and $52 million of incremental operating expenses related to the merger. Excluding these items, noninterest expense was up $35 million.\n",
      "Personnel expense increased $41 million compared to the prior quarter. Excluding an increase of $35 million in incremental operating expenses related to the merger, personnel expense increased $6 million. This includes a $23 million increase for certain post-employment benefits expense, which is offset by higher noninterest income. Production-based incentives expense and equity-based compensation decreased compared to the prior quarter. Professional services expense increased $16 million partially due to incremental operating expenses related to the merger. Other expense increased $20 million due to higher advertising and marketing expenses and other sundry items.\n",
      "The provision for income taxes was $218 million for the third quarter, compared to $234 million for the prior quarter. The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 20.8 percent, compared to 20.9 percent for the prior quarter.\n",
      "Third Quarter 2019 compared to Third Quarter 2018\n",
      "Total taxable-equivalent revenues were $3.0 billion for the third quarter of 2019, an increase of $73 million compared to the earlier quarter, which reflects an increase of $9 million in taxable-equivalent net interest income and an increase of $64 million in noninterest income.\n",
      "Net interest margin was 3.37 percent, down ten basis points compared to the earlier quarter. Average earning assets increased $7.2 billion. The increase in average earning assets reflects a $4.6 billion increase in average total loans and leases and a $2.6 billion increase in average securities. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $7.1 billion compared to the earlier quarter. Average interest-bearing deposits increased $6.4 billion and average short-term borrowings increased $2.3 billion, while average long-term debt decreased $1.6 billion. The yield on the total loan portfolio for the third quarter of 2019 was 4.98 percent, up 15 basis points compared to the earlier quarter, reflecting the impact of rate increases. The yield on the average securities portfolio was 2.60 percent, up 13 basis points compared to the earlier period.\n",
      "The average cost of total deposits was 0.67 percent, up 24 basis points compared to the earlier quarter. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits was 0.99 percent, up 33 basis points compared to the earlier quarter. The average rate on long-term debt was 3.42 percent, up 43 basis points compared to the earlier quarter. The average rate on short-term borrowings was 2.55 percent, up 61 basis points compared to the earlier quarter. The higher rates on interest-bearing liabilities reflect the impact of rate increases.\n",
      "The provision for credit losses was $117 million, compared to $135 million for the earlier quarter. The decrease in the provision for credit losses was primarily due to the residential mortgage loan sale in the current quarter. Net charge-offs for the third quarter of 2019 totaled $153 million compared to $127 million in the earlier quarter.\n",
      "Noninterest income for the third quarter of 2019 increased $64 million compared to the earlier quarter. Insurance income increased $39 million due to higher production. Mortgage banking income increased $33 million primarily due to higher production revenues from both residential and commercial mortgage banking businesses. Investment banking brokerage fees and commissions increased $14 million due to higher managed account fees and higher investment banking transaction revenues. Other income decreased $29 million primarily due to a decrease in income from SBIC private equity investments.\n",
      "Noninterest expense for the third quarter of 2019 was up $98 million compared to the earlier quarter. Merger-related and restructuring charges increased $16 million, as the current quarter included charges in connection with the announced merger of equals with SunTrust, whereas the earlier quarter included charges associated with facilities optimization and the Regions Insurance acquisition. The current quarter also included $52 million of incremental operating expenses related to the merger. Excluding these charges, noninterest expense was up $30 million, or 1.7 percent compared to the earlier quarter.\n",
      "Personnel expense increased $57 million compared to the earlier quarter. Excluding an increase of $39 million in incremental operating expenses related to the merger, personnel expense increased $18 million compared to the earlier quarter. The remaining increase in personnel expense was primarily due to an increase in production-based incentive expense. Professional services expense increased $14 million primarily due to incremental operating expenses related to the merger. Regulatory charges decreased $17 million, primarily the result of the deposit insurance fund reaching the targeted level. Other expense increased $35 million due to higher non-service related pension expense, higher operating charge-offs, higher advertising and marketing expenses and other sundry items.\n",
      "The provision for income taxes was $218 million for the third quarter of 2019, compared to $210 million for the earlier quarter. This produced an effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2019 of 20.8 percent, compared to 20.0 percent for the earlier quarter.\n",

CB-Retail includes Dealer Retail Services, which originates loans on an indirect basis to consumers for the purchase of automobiles, boats and recreational vehicles. Additionally, CB-Retail includes specialty finance lending, small equipment leasing and other products for consumers. CB-Retail also includes Residential Mortgage Banking, which originates and purchases mortgage loans to either hold for investment or sell to third parties. BB&T generally retains the servicing rights to loans sold. Mortgage products include fixed and adjustable-rate government guaranteed and conventional loans used for the purpose of constructing, purchasing or refinancing residential properties. Substantially all of the properties are owner-occupied. Residential Mortgage Banking also includes Mortgage Warehouse Lending, which provides short-term lending solutions to finance first-lien residential mortgages held-for-sale by independent mortgage companies.\n",
      "CB-Retail net income was $446 million for the third quarter of 2019, a slight increase compared to the prior quarter. Segment net interest income increased $36 million primarily due to higher credit spreads on loans, higher loans held for sale balances and an additional day in the current quarter. Noninterest income decreased $15 million primarily due to decreases in mortgage banking income resulting from net residential mortgage servicing rights valuation adjustments in the prior quarter. The allocated provision for credit losses decreased $8 million primarily due to declines in average loan balances resulting from the residential mortgage portfolio sale, partially offset by increased incurred loss estimates in various retail portfolios and seasonally higher net charge-offs. Noninterest expense increased $27 million primarily due to incremental operating expenses related to the merger in the current quarter.\n",
      "CB-Retail average loans and leases held for investment decreased $2.5 billion, or 14.5 percent on an annualized basis, compared to the prior quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by decreases in average residential mortgage loans of $3.7 billion due to the residential mortgage portfolio sale, partially offset by increases in average mortgage warehouse lending of $652 million and average indirect lending of $483 million.\n",
      "CB-Retail average total deposits decreased $141 million, or 0.7 percent on an annualized basis, compared to the prior quarter.

      "FS&CF net income was $185 million for the third quarter of 2019, an increase of $16 million compared to the prior quarter. Noninterest income increased $22 million primarily due to higher commercial mortgage banking income due to higher production volumes, and client derivatives largely due to decreased valuation reserves and higher sales volumes. The allocated provision for credit losses decreased $11 million due to lower net charge-offs and decreased incurred loss estimates primarily attributable to the asset based lending portfolio. Noninterest expense increased $16 million primarily due to higher performance-based incentives, depreciation on property under operating leases and professional services in the current quarter.\n",
      "FS&CF average loans and leases held for investment increased $569 million, or 7.6 percent on an annualized basis, compared to the prior quarter.
